# Objective
    To familiarize students with polymorphism concepts.

# Polymorphism 
Polymorphism is the ability to use an operator or function in different ways. It gives different meanings
or functions to the operators or functions.

## Varieties of Polymorphism (Types)
1. Compile time (Function overloading and operator overloading).
2. Run time (virtual function).

# Function Overloading
Defining multiple functions with same name is known as function overloading.
Arguments in the overloaded functions must not be same in number i.e. same function name different
number of arguments.

# Operator Overloading
It is a mechanism that provides the operators a special meaning certain usage.

## Syntax
return-type operator symbol (arguments)
{
    define task of operator.
}
